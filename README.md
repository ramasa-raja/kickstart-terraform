# EKS Terraform – Practice and Experiments

This repo is based on the kickstart-terraform templates from SloopStash.  
I use it to practice and experiment with Terraform patterns and EKS-style infrastructure.

I change variables, modules and backends here to understand:

- How to organise Terraform for multiple environments  
- How AWS networking, IAM and EKS fit together  
- How to reuse modules instead of writing everything from scratch

# Kickstart Terraform
Automate multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning parallely on AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform.


## Getting started
Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sloopstash/kickstart-terraform/wiki) for detailed instructions on how to get started with our Terraform starter-kit.
